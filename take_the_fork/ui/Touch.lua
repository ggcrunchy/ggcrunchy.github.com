--- Builds a function (on top of @{TouchHelperFunc}) to be assigned as a **"touch"**
-- listener, which will drag the target's parent around when moved, subject to clamping at
-- the screen edges.
--
-- The **m\_dragx** and **m\_dragy** fields are intrusively assigned to in the event target.
-- @number hscale Height scale, &ge; 1 (if absent, 1). The parent may be taller than the
-- touched object, e.g. in the case of a title bar, which affects vertical clamping. The
-- final metric is: parent height = _hscale_ * object height.
-- @treturn function Listener function.
--
-- **CONSIDER**: More automagic than hscale? Varieties of clamping?
--
-- **TODO**: May start in "broken" state, i.e. in violation of the clamping

--- Builds a function to be assigned as a **"touch"** listener, which handles various common
-- details of touch management.
--
-- Each of the arguments are assumed to be functions called as `func(event, target)`, where
-- _event_ is the normal touch listener parameter, and _target_ is provided as a convenience
-- for _event_.**target**.
-- @callable began Called when the target has begun to be touched.
-- @callable moved Optional. Called if the target's touch moved.
-- @callable ended Optional. Called if the target's touch has ended or been cancelled.
-- @treturn function Listener function, which always returns **true**.
--
-- You may simulate a touch by feeding an **id** of **"ignore_me"** through _event_, all
-- other fields being normal. Otherwise, the focus of the id'touch is updated.
