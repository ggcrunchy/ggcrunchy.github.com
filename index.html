        <h3>Amazing stuff</h3>

		<p>A fumbling (and late-started) attempt at a game for Github's Game Off 2012: <a href="TakeTheFork/take_the_fork/index.html">Take The Fork</a></p>
		<p>This is a proof of concept more than anything. I've since incorporated the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwiko71qVw">Binary Land</a>
		mechanic into a different project, and a friend of mine did something cool with it too: <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/puzzle/abbigale-and-the-monster/13374/">
		Abbigale and the Monster</a></p>
		<p>The link may or may not work&mdash;I think it times out? It compiles <b>A LOT</b> of Lua to Javascript, with no caching to speak
		of, and I imagine this is the reason. If so, do a refresh... or two.</p>
		<p>It emulates pieces of the <a href="http://www.coronalabs.com">Corona SDK</a>, namely (some of) the display library, most of the
		transition and timer libraries, event listeners, plus some odds and ends. This allowed me to bring in several modules I'd developed.</p>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/ghoulsblade/love-webplayer">Love2D WebPlayer</a> was used under the hood, and <a href="https://github.com/mherkender/lua.js">lua.js</a>
		beneath that. These are both cool projects, but unfortunately my toolkit seems to be wide-ranging enough to flush out all the NYI
		Lua corner cases. :D This quickly saw me acquainted with <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/">Dragonfly</a>.</p>
		<p>I spent too much time distracted from the game itself, and it looks like even the core logic only half works. I may re-explore
		the idea, though probably with one of the Emscripten-based VM's (for the more approximate feature-completeness more than anything).</p>
